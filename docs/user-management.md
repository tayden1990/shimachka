## Technical Details

### Database Operations

**User Deletion Process:**
1. Delete user record (`user:{userId}`)
2. Delete all user cards (`card:{userId}:*`)
3. Delete all user sessions (`session:{userId}:*`)
4. Delete user topics (`topic:{userId}:*`)

**User Activation/Deactivation:**
- Updates the `isActive` field in user record
- Deactivated users retain all data but cannot access bot

### API Endpoints

- `GET /admin/users` - Fetch users with pagination and filtering
- `DELETE /admin/users/{userId}` - Delete user and all data
- `PUT /admin/users/{userId}` - Update user (activate/deactivate)
- `POST /admin/users/{userId}/reset-progress` - Reset learning progress
- `GET /admin/users/{userId}/export` - Export user data

### Security Considerations

- All operations require admin authentication
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Demo users cannot be modified (safety measure)
- All actions are logged for audit purposes

## Getting Real Users

To start seeing real users in your admin panel:

1. **Deploy Your Bot**: Ensure your bot is deployed to Cloudflare Workers
2. **Share Bot Link**: Share `https://t.me/your_bot_username` with users
3. **User Registration**: Users interact with `/start` command
4. **Data Population**: Real users appear in admin panel automatically

## Monitoring and Analytics

- **Real-time Updates**: User list updates with latest activity
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitor user engagement and learning patterns
- **Progress Analytics**: Track learning effectiveness across users
- **Export Capabilities**: Download user data for external analysis

## Best Practices

### User Management
- Regular monitoring of user activity
- Prompt handling of inactive accounts
- Export data before major operations
- Use deactivation before deletion when possible

### Data Privacy
- Export user data upon request
- Secure deletion when required
- Transparent communication about data handling
- Respect user privacy preferences

### Performance
- Use pagination for large user lists
- Filter users to reduce display load
- Regular database cleanup of inactive accounts
- Monitor storage usage in Cloudflare KV

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Demo Mode Won't Switch Off:**
- Check if users have completed registration
- Verify bot deployment is successful
- Ensure KV storage is accessible

**User Deletion Fails:**
- Check admin permissions
- Verify user exists in database
- Review error logs for specific issues

**Performance Issues:**
- Reduce page size for user lists
