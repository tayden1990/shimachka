# Cloudflare Workers Logging & Monitoring Guide

## Overview
This guide covers comprehensive logging, monitoring, and debugging for the Leitner Telegram Bot deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

## üîç Available Logging Features

### 1. Real-time Logs
```powershell
# View live logs with pretty formatting
npm run logs:live

npm run logs:search "ERROR"
npm run logs:search "vocabulary"
```

### 2. Analytics Engine Integration
- **Structured Events**: All major bot events are logged to Analytics Engine
- **Performance Metrics**: Request duration, error rates, command processing times
- **User Activity**: Command usage, vocabulary extraction success/failure rates
- **System Health**: Service uptime, API response times

### 3. Debug Endpoints

#### Health Check
```
GET https://leitner-telegram-bot.t-ak-sa.workers.dev/health
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": {
    "botTokenSet": true,
    "geminiKeySet": true,
    "kvSet": true
  }
}
```

   - Vocabulary extraction failures

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Commands

### Local Development with Enhanced Logging
```powershell
# Start development server with debug logging
npm run debug

# Build and check for errors
npm run build

# Deploy with logging enabled
npm run deploy
```

### Production Debugging

#### View Recent Logs
```powershell
# Last 100 log entries
wrangler tail --format=pretty

# Filter for errors only
wrangler tail --format=pretty | Select-String "ERROR"

# Search for specific user issues
wrangler tail --search "user_id:12345"
```

#### Analytics Queries
```powershell
# View analytics data
wrangler analytics

# Custom queries (if configured)
wrangler analytics --query="SELECT * FROM events WHERE eventType='VOCABULARY_EXTRACTION_ERROR'"
```

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Request Tracking
Every request logs:
- Start time and duration
- HTTP method and path
- User agent and CF data
- Response status
- Error details (if any)

### Error Tracking
Enhanced error logging includes:
- Full error messages
- Stack traces
- Request context
- User information
- Timestamp and duration

### Vocabulary Extraction Monitoring
Specific tracking for AI operations:
- Gemini API call success/failure
- Response parsing errors
- Token usage (if applicable)
- Processing time

## üö® Common Issues & Debugging

### Issue: Bot Not Responding
1. Check health endpoint
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check recent error logs:
   ```powershell
   npm run logs:search "ERROR"
   ```

### Issue: Vocabulary Extraction Failing
1. Check Gemini API status
2. Look for extraction errors:
   ```powershell
   npm run logs:search "vocabulary.*extraction.*error"
   ```
3. Verify API key is set correctly

### Issue: High Response Times
1. Monitor performance metrics
2. Check KV operation times
3. Review API call latencies:
   ```powershell
   npm run logs:search "REQUEST_COMPLETE"
   ```
