# Telegram Bot Command Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: `/start` command not working

### Quick Fixes Applied ‚úÖ

1. **Fixed Command Parsing Bug** - There was a missing space in the command handling logic
2. **Enhanced User Creation** - Added proper `isRegistrationComplete` field handling
3. **Added Comprehensive Debugging** - Extensive logging for troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting Steps

#### 1. Check Bot Token and Webhook
```powershell
# Test webhook status
.\test-webhook.ps1 -BOT_TOKEN "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"

# Debug bot info
.\debug-bot.ps1 -BOT_TOKEN "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```

#### 2. Deploy Updated Code
```powershell
# Build and deploy
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

#### 3. Reset Webhook (if needed)
```powershell
# Run the webhook setup
.\setup-webhook.ps1
```

#### 4. Test in Telegram
- Send `/start` to your bot
- Check Cloudflare Workers logs for debugging output

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Bot doesn't respond to any commands"
**Causes:**
- Webhook not properly configured
- Bot token incorrect
- Cloudflare Worker not deployed
- Worker URL not accessible

**Solutions:**
1. Verify bot token in secrets: `wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
2. Check webhook URL: should match your deployed worker
3. Test worker URL directly in browser
4. Check Cloudflare dashboard for errors

#### Issue: "Bot responds but commands don't work"
**Causes:**
- Command parsing error (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- User registration state issues
- Database/KV storage problems

**Solutions:**
1. Use `/debug_state` command to check user state
2. Use `/reset_registration` to clear user state
3. Check KV namespace binding in wrangler.toml

#### Issue: "Registration flow gets stuck"
**Causes:**
- Missing conversation state
- Callback query handling issues
- Language selection problems

**Solutions:**
1. Send `/start` again to restart registration
2. Use callback buttons instead of text input
3. Check worker logs for specific errors

### Environment Variables Required

Make sure these secrets are set:
```powershell
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### Debug Commands Available

- `/debug_state` - Shows user and conversation state
- `/reset_registration` - Clears registration state
- `/start` - Begins registration or shows main menu

### Logs to Check

#### In Cloudflare Workers Dashboard:
1. Go to Workers & Pages
2. Select your worker
3. Go to Logs tab
4. Look for these patterns:
   - `üîµ Received Telegram update`
   - `üöÄ /start command received`
   - `‚ùå` error indicators
   - `‚úÖ` success indicators

#### Expected Log Flow for /start:
```
üîµ Received Telegram update
üì® Message received
üîÑ Processing message
üë§ User lookup result
ü§ñ handleCommand called
üöÄ /start command received
‚úÖ User is registered, sending welcome message
üì§ Sending message to chat
‚úÖ Message sent successfully
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Bot token is correct and set as secret
- [ ] Webhook URL points to deployed worker
- [ ] Worker is deployed and accessible
- [ ] KV namespace is properly bound
- [ ] `/start` command triggers registration or welcome
- [ ] Bot responds within 30 seconds
- [ ] Logs show successful message processing

### Manual Testing Commands

```powershell
# Test bot info
curl -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getMe"

# Test webhook info  
curl -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"

# Test worker endpoint
curl -X GET "https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/"
```

### If Nothing Works

1. **Complete Reset:**
   ```powershell
   # Delete webhook
   curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/deleteWebhook"
   
   # Redeploy worker
   npm run deploy
   
   # Set webhook again
   .\setup-webhook.ps1
   ```

2. **Check Bot Permissions:**
   - Bot should have permission to send messages
   - Bot should not be blocked by user
   - Bot should be added to correct chat

3. **Verify Worker URL:**
   - URL should be HTTPS
   - Should return 200 OK for GET requests
   - Should be accessible from Telegram servers

### Success Indicators

‚úÖ Webhook status shows your worker URL
‚úÖ Bot responds to `/start` with registration or welcome
‚úÖ Worker logs show message processing
‚úÖ No error messages in Cloudflare dashboard
‚úÖ Bot responds within reasonable time

If you still have issues after following this guide, check the specific error messages in the worker logs and provide them for further troubleshooting.
