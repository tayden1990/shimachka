## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to the project maintainers. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Password hashing using Web Crypto API with SHA-256
- ✅ Constant-time password comparison to prevent timing attacks
- ✅ JWT-based authentication for admin panel
- ✅ Authentication required for all admin endpoints
- ✅ CORS headers properly configured

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Input validation functions implemented
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (using KV store, not SQL)
- ✅ XSS prevention through input sanitization
- ✅ Request size limits via Cloudflare Workers

### API Security
- ✅ Environment variables properly secured
- ✅ No API keys in source code
- ✅ Webhook secret validation
- ✅ Rate limiting via Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ HTTPS-only communication

### Data Protection
- ✅ Sensitive data encryption at rest (Cloudflare KV)
- ✅ No plain text password storage
- ✅ Audit logging for admin actions
- ✅ Data access controls

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers serverless architecture
- ✅ Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Environment separation (staging/production)
- ✅ Secret management via GitHub Secrets

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

1. **API Keys Management**
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Use different keys for staging/production
   - Never commit keys to version control

2. **Access Control**
   - Use strong admin passwords
   - Implement 2FA where possible
   - Regular access review
   - Principle of least privilege

3. **Monitoring**
   - Enable Cloudflare security features
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerting for failed authentication attempts
   - Regular security audits

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Password Hashing**: Currently using SHA-256 with salt. Consider upgrading to bcrypt or Argon2 for enhanced security.

2. **Session Management**: JWT tokens are stateless. Consider implementing token revocation for enhanced security.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Relies on Cloudflare Workers built-in limits. Consider implementing application-level rate limiting for specific endpoints.

## Security Updates

This project follows responsible disclosure practices. Security updates will be released as soon as possible after verification.
